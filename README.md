Personal project: self-driving 2-d car with a neural network visualizer.

## Base model: 
implementing the car, controls, road, sensor and the canvas.

## 1st upgrade :
- use segment intersection to detect the road borders and other objects
- detect collision against the car's geometric segments and other objects 
- create dummy cars to represent random traffic
